Seed Revolution
--------------------------------------------
Within recent years, there are many researchers work with the conservation of global biological diversity.  Becuase of the 
climate change, natural disasters or wars, the diversity of the seeds can be influenced. We found that there is a global seed 
vault on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen. The seed vault is to avoid the loss of seeds by lots of reasons in the world. 
The goal of this project is to achieve to analyse to find out the relationships between seeds and countries around the world.  
We will use the collected data of seed's genus to analyse the staple food in different countries, and the price of them.  
Depend on ten years of the numbers of the seeds deposit to analyse the price of the staple food in each country. Especially, 
we will use the seeds collection data to analyse the problem of famine.  With the real data, we will find out the scarce seeds 
in each country. These data analyse results could encourage and help the agriculture to develop their producing. Moreover, the 
data analysis results can help to researchers find out and solve the problem of the famine.
